		<p class="mission">Fixing Felines of Islip Township(FFIT) is a 501© 3 tax exempt public charity whose mission is to help end the overpopulation of homeless, abandoned, and unwanted feral and stray cats/kittens. FFIT mission will be accomplished by a mobile spay/neuter unit that will offer assistance in sterilization, vaccination (including, though not limited to, rabies and other feline viruses), flea/tick, deworming treatments and mandatory ear tip identifiers to the homeless feline community. The formation of the FFIT youth group will help serve to promote feline health and welfare throughout Long Island communities.  Benefits of this program include the reduction of disease, territory marking/spraying, malnutrition, fighting, environmental dangers such as cars, weather conditions, wildlife and malevolent forces.  The inception of FFIT also means that resources used at local animal shelters to care for the overpopulation of cats will be greatly reduced. FFIT’s target audience includes, but is not limited to, colony caretakers, senior citizens, veterans, therapy/companion pets and so much more!</p>
