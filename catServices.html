<h1>Spay/Neuter Services</h1>


 <h4>As pet owners ourselves, we at Fixing Felines of Islip Township understand that you only want the best for your loyal companions. Some of the benefits of spaying or neutering your cat(as well as for any community cats) are tr reduce the chances of males and females developing mammary or testicular cancers. Males will also have a lessened drive to mate and assert territorial dominance while females will not be able to produce unwanted litters of kittens The tendency to roam and/or show aggressive behaviors is also reduced.</h4>
